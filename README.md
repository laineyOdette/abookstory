# A Book Story

_In looking at a collection of data about readers, books, and the ratings readers assigned - what can we learn?_

## Objective
The focus of the project was to develop my own hypotheses, use advanced analytical approaches to help test hypotheses, and present results in a Tableau storyboard.

## Tools and Skills
- Tableau
- Python
- Sourcing open data
- Data wrangling
- Data merging
- Exploratory analysis through visualizations (scatterplots, correlation heatmaps, pair plots, and categorical plots);
- Geospatial analysis using a shapefile;
- Supervised machine learning through regression analysis;
- Unsupervised machine learning through cluster analysis;
- Time-series analysis;
- Analysis narrative (storytelling) and final results

For this project, I leveraged the following Python libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- MatPlotLib
- Seaborn
- PyPlot
- Folium
